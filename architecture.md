# Polymarket Pulse — System Architecture

This document describes the technical architecture.

# Active Execution Plan Link

Operational 14-day delivery plan is versioned in:

`docs/plan_14day_seo_bot_growth_2026-03-09.md`

Architecture and rollout priorities must stay aligned with that plan and with `manifest.md`.

---

# Operational Snapshot (2026-03-11)

Latest scope verification covered `db` migrations/views, ingest code path, bot runtime path, and web/SEO rendering path.

Current live-state highlights:

• ingest freshness is within one 5-minute bucket (`latest market_snapshots bucket lag ~540s` at capture time)
• live universe contract remains `200` markets with active-only filtering and balanced category rebalance in function layer
• universe source split at snapshot time: `auto=199`, `manual=1`; no closed markets present in universe
• bot/user layer remains multi-tenant schema-first (`app.*` + `bot.*`) with Telegram identity resolution and plan lookup through `bot.current_plan(...)`
• monetization plumbing is deployed (`app.payment_events`, Stars handlers, Stripe endpoints), but no successful payment event is currently stored
• landing + SEO pages are running one visual contract (dark palette, `Space Grotesk` + `JetBrains Mono`, short reveal animations, shared CTA hierarchy)

Operational risks observed in runtime evidence:

• polling conflict occurred in bot logs (`getUpdates 409`) indicating concurrent bot instance overlap on 2026-03-05
• local launchd bot service currently not loaded, so local process state does not represent persistent production uptime
• free-plan historical watchlist rows can exceed current add-flow cap due to legacy records; cap is enforced on new writes in bot command handlers

---

# Bot Guide Surface Update (2026-03-11)

Added dedicated bot guidance surfaces into the web layer:

• `GET /how-it-works` -> scenario-first command onboarding (RU/EN templates)
• `GET /commands` -> full command reference (RU/EN templates)

Routing and discovery contract:

• both pages are localized through existing `detect_lang(...)` + `?lang=...`
• both pages are published in `sitemap.xml` (`en` + `ru` variants)
• landing and SEO `/telegram-bot` include explicit handoff to `/how-it-works`
• bidirectional nav between guide surfaces:
  - `/how-it-works` -> `/commands`
  - `/commands` -> `/how-it-works`

Telemetry contract remains stable:

• no new site event types
• attribution is captured via existing `page_view` + `details.placement`

---

# Live Movers Preview Contract Update (2026-03-12)

Landing endpoint `GET /api/live-movers-preview` now uses a snapshot-window spark contract:

• spark source is per-market `market_snapshots` history (up to last 16 points), not a short fixed-hour cut only  
• points are ordered strictly `ts_bucket ASC` (old -> new) for left-to-right chart consistency  
• value extraction is yes-side mid with fallback to available side quote when only one side is present  
• if fewer than 2 points exist for a market, API returns `spark: []` (frontend handles empty sparkline)

To keep visual signal quality on landing, preview row selection prioritizes movers with richer spark history.

---

# Data Pipeline

Polymarket API
→ ingest pipeline
→ Postgres storage
→ analytics views
→ delivery layer

---

# Components

## Ingest

Python service.

Responsibilities:

• fetch market data
• rebalance fetched market pool by category + root-question dedup
• normalize responses
• write snapshots
• maintain universe coverage with balanced category pull

Snapshot writes are the critical path.

Universe refresh runs after snapshot commit and is allowed to fail without failing the whole ingest run.

Runs as:

• GitHub Actions scheduled job (backup)
• Railway worker loop (`ingest/worker.py`) for stable cadence

Worker interval is controlled by `INGEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
GitHub backup schedule is hourly.

---

## Database

Supabase Postgres.

Stores:

markets
market_snapshots
market_universe
user_positions
user_watchlist
app.users
app.identities
app.subscriptions
app.email_subscribers
app.upgrade_intents
app.site_events
bot.profiles
bot.user_settings
bot.watchlist
bot.alert_events
bot.sent_alerts_log

Derived views compute analytics.

---

## Analytics Layer

SQL views calculate signals.

Examples:

top_movers_latest
portfolio_snapshot_latest
watchlist_snapshot_latest
alerts_latest
watchlist_alerts_latest
alerts_inbox_latest

These views produce:

• probability deltas
• spread signals
• portfolio changes

---

## Delivery Layer

Telegram bot.

Reads alerts from `bot` analytics views only.

Commands:

/start
/movers
/watchlist
/inbox
/plan
/help
/menu

Advanced (typed or via `/help`):

/upgrade
/limits
/threshold
/inbox20
/watchlist_list
/watchlist_add
/watchlist_remove
/admin_stats

Also runs:

• scheduled push loop
• freemium enforcement (watchlist + daily alert caps)
• onboarding/plan UX layer (`/start`, `/help`, `/limits`, `/upgrade`) for conversion to paid plan
• compact Telegram command menu with advanced commands moved to `/help`
• quick-reply keyboard on `/start` for core actions (`/movers`, `/watchlist`, `/inbox`, `/plan`)
• callback action menu (`/menu`) with inline buttons for movers/watchlist/inbox/plan/picker/threshold
• watchlist picker flow uses mover-first candidates ranked by live liquidity (volume proxy), with live-liquidity fallback and callback tokens in bot memory
• picker supports category-level callback filters (`all`, `crypto`, `politics`, `macro`) on top of liquidity-ranked candidates
• picker data source uses latest per-market quote from a rolling 6h snapshot window (not strictly one latest bucket), improving candidate breadth during sparse windows
• picker excludes markets already in user watchlist to keep “add next market” flow actionable
• category filter behavior is strict: no cross-category fallback; empty category returns explicit UX guidance
• `all` picker mode applies category-balanced quotas and ordering to reduce crypto dominance in candidate list
• category/refresh picker callbacks edit existing picker message instead of appending new bot messages, reducing chat noise
• picker UI includes category tags and live-supply hint (candidate count in current window)
• picker candidate pool includes recent active markets (last 72h seen in snapshots) as fallback when live movers are too narrow
• `/upgrade` command writes conversion intent into `app.upgrade_intents`
• monetization offer v1 in bot UX:
  - FREE: 3 watchlist markets, 20 push/day
  - PRO: 20 watchlist markets + email digest
  - pricing target: USD-equivalent monthly payment in Telegram Stars
  - current configured Stars invoice: `454 XTR`
• upgrade command UX contract:
  - send concise PRO offer message first (FREE vs PRO delta + Stripe fallback link)
  - send Telegram Stars invoice immediately after, in the same handler
  - no intermediate inline keyboard between message and invoice
  - `/plan` ends with explicit upgrade CTA line (`/upgrade`) localized by Telegram user locale
• bilingual delivery contract:
  - bot locale is resolved from Telegram `language_code` (`en-*` -> EN, fallback RU)
  - command/menu copy has RU and EN variants for core command set
  - Telegram command catalog is registered in two language scopes (`ru`, `en`)
  - bot profile metadata is set at startup for both locales (`setMyDescription`, `setMyShortDescription`)
• Telegram Stars payment handlers:
  - pre-checkout validation handler
  - successful payment handler that upserts `app.payment_events` and activates `app.subscriptions`
• adaptive signal windows in read path (`latest`, then `30m`, then `1h`) for movers/watchlist views
• zero-state diagnostics for inbox/watchlist to distinguish threshold filtering vs missing live quotes

Site + Email API:

• FastAPI app in `api/main.py`
• waitlist form + double opt-in
• daily digest worker in `api/digest_job.py` via Resend
• geo/lang-aware landing renderer (`api/web/*.ru.html`, `api/web/*.en.html`)
• SEO endpoints: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/og-card.svg`
• SEO intent endpoints: `/analytics`, `/dashboard`, `/signals`, `/telegram-bot`, `/top-movers`, `/watchlist-alerts`
• favicon endpoint: `/favicon.svg` (and `/favicon.ico` fallback)
• site telemetry endpoint: `/api/events` (`page_view`, `tg_click`, `waitlist_intent`, `checkout_intent`)
• live landing data endpoint: `/api/live-movers-preview` (top 3 movers + sparkline points from DB)
• attribution enrichment in telemetry: `placement`, `lang`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`
• landing uses dark trading-terminal UI with pain-driven hero, live DB-powered “Top movers” widget (3 markets + sparkline mini-charts), scarcity line, and dual CTA (Telegram primary + email waitlist)
• landing visual contract upgraded to App Store-grade presentation:
  - typography pair: `Space Grotesk` (display) + `JetBrains Mono` (data/terminal copy)
  - hero includes product/rating badges and compact signal-performance metrics cards
  - dedicated `Preview screens` section (3 product-surface cards) added between hero and proof modules
  - “App Store-grade UX” badge copy removed from EN/RU templates and SEO renderer to reduce marketing noise
  - hero two-column block (`movers` + `CTA`) now uses equal-height grid/flex alignment to prevent visual seam at column join
• landing includes conversion modules: “what you get in 60 seconds”, mobile sticky Telegram CTA, and static `Historical examples` proof block
• Google Analytics gtag (`G-J901VRQH4G`) injected in landing heads
• site funnel event tracking in `app.site_events` with dual-delivery:
  - GA4 mirror via `gtag('event', ...)`
  - `sendBeacon` primary delivery + `fetch keepalive` fallback for outbound-click reliability
• landing conversion placements explicitly tracked: `hero_panel`, `mobile_sticky`, `how_it_works_link`, `pro_offer`, `pro_stars`, `waitlist_form`
• SEO telemetry events include `waitlist_intent` on intent pages
• Cloudflare edge DNS + TLS + apex domain (`polymarketpulse.app`)
• Resend mail-auth DNS hosted in Cloudflare (`resend._domainkey` + `send.polymarketpulse.app` SPF)
• Resend domain `polymarketpulse.app` is `verified`
• canonical/og/twitter metadata is absolute URL based
• `hreflang` includes `x-default`
• sitemap publishes localized EN/RU variants for crawl coverage
• schema.org JSON-LD is present on landing (`Organization`, `WebSite`) and SEO intent pages (`WebPage`)
• ops credential inventory for monetization + social distribution lives in `docs/credentials_checklist.md`
• Stripe monetization endpoints:
  - `POST /api/stripe/checkout-session`
  - `GET /stripe/success` (checkout confirmation fallback when webhook is absent)
  - `POST /api/stripe/webhook` (HMAC-verified)
• Landing conversion hierarchy preserved: Telegram + waitlist remain primary; Stripe checkout is isolated in a lower-page PRO block
• Landing PRO block contract (EN/RU):
  - full-width dark section (`#0d0f0e`), no outer rounded card wrapper
  - split layout: FREE/PRO comparison rows + stacked CTAs
  - primary green Stars CTA + secondary outlined Stripe CTA (existing checkout-session flow)
  - mobile behavior: single-column stack with full-width CTA buttons
• SEO page renderer (`render_seo_page`) now mirrors landing visual system:
  - badge row, compact stats cards, preview-surface cards, and CTA row hierarchy
  - same dark palette + typography pair as landing
• Motion contract for web surfaces:
  - one-shot reveal animations (`<= 300ms`) for entry/stagger
  - no infinite decorative animations
  - mandatory `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback

## Current User Interaction Surfaces (2026-03-10)

End-user entry points and flows:

• Web entry: `polymarketpulse.app` landing and intent pages (`/analytics`, `/dashboard`, `/signals`, `/telegram-bot`, `/top-movers`, `/watchlist-alerts`)
• Primary CTA path: web Telegram CTA (hero/sticky/SEO CTA) -> `@polymarket_pulse_bot` with `start` payload attribution
• Secondary CTA path: web waitlist form -> `/api/waitlist` -> `/confirm` double opt-in -> email digest channel
• Bot activation core: `/start` -> `/menu` + `/movers` -> watchlist add (`/watchlist_add` or picker) -> `/inbox` + push alerts
• Signal fallback behavior in bot read paths: `latest -> 30m -> 1h` before zero-state explanation

Telemetry and attribution contract:

• site events: `page_view`, `tg_click`, `waitlist_intent` via `/api/events`
• waitlist events: `waitlist_submit`, `confirm_success`, `unsubscribe_success` in `app.site_events`
• attribution fields: `placement`, `lang`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`

# UI System Contract

All web surfaces (landing + SEO intent pages) must use one visual contract.

Hard rules:

• Dark-only backgrounds (`#0d0f0e` / `#0a0c0b`) and dark cards (`#131714`, border `#1e2520`)
• Off-white text (`#e8ede9`) + muted data text (`#8fa88f` / `#6b7a6e`)
• Green (`#00ff88`) only for CTA/positive/active states
• Red (`#ff4444`) only for negative deltas
• Typography: `Space Grotesk` for display/headings, `JetBrains Mono` for data labels/copy
• Motion: short one-shot reveal/stagger transitions only (`<=300ms`), no infinite decorative loops
• No light sections, no yellow CTA variants, no bullet lists on SEO pages
• Data blocks use shared primitives: dark feature rows, dark intent pills, dark FAQ callouts

Enforcement points in code:

• `api/web/index.en.html`
• `api/web/index.ru.html`
• `api/main.py::render_seo_page`

---

# Universe System

Universe defines markets actively tracked.

Sources:

manual — explicit user watchlist markets
position — user portfolio markets
auto — live liquid markets with both latest and previous buckets

Universe ensures ingest coverage.

Current forced list in ingest:

manual watchlist (`public.user_watchlist` + `bot.watchlist`)
market universe
user positions

Universe refresh is a post-write step with its own timeout budget.

Universe read selection in ingest is category-balanced (caps + top-up), not pure weight sort, to avoid single-topic dominance.

Ingest observability:

• startup log prints fetched market mix (`p/m/c/o`) for top fetch
• forced-list log prints selected universe mix (`p/m/c/o`) before snapshot write

Live-only hardening:

• migration `db/migrations/005_live_only_hardening.sql` enforces `active` status across universe rebuild and snapshot views
• `closed` markets are excluded from `public.market_universe` even when passed from manual/position sources
• bot watchlist snapshot view is aligned to active-only universe contract

---

# Alert Engine

Alerts are generated when:

probability change exceeds per-user threshold.

Alert flow:

market_snapshots
→ bot.portfolio_snapshot_latest / bot.watchlist_snapshot_latest
→ bot.portfolio_alerts_latest / bot.watchlist_alerts_latest
→ bot.alerts_inbox_latest
→ bot

Live movers flow:

market_snapshots
→ market_universe
→ top_movers_latest
→ /movers command

Watchlist flow:

market_snapshots
→ market_universe
→ bot.watchlist_snapshot_latest
→ bot.watchlist_alerts_latest
→ bot.alerts_inbox_latest
→ /watchlist and push

Email flow:

site form / bot opt-in
→ app.email_subscribers (confirm_token)
→ /confirm (double opt-in)
→ bot.alert_events aggregation
→ api/digest_job.py
→ bot.sent_alerts_log (channel=email)
→ subscriber inbox

Attribution flow:

landing query params (`utm_*`)
→ `/api/events` and `/api/waitlist` payload
→ `app.site_events.details`
→ funnel analysis split by source/channel

Digest orchestration:

• GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/digest.yml` runs daily
• manual run is available via `workflow_dispatch`

Growth ops:

• competitor scan script: `scripts/growth/competitive_scan.py` (parses polymark.et tool index)
• competitive decision docs:
  - `docs/competitive_gap_matrix_2026-03-12.md` (top-7 gap matrix + interception angles + 7-day execution list)
  - `docs/competitive_sweep_latest.md` (top-30 directory baseline and cluster mix)
• social draft generator: `scripts/growth/generate_social_drafts.py` (DB live views -> EN/RU drafts for X/Threads, with UTM links + Telegram deep links)
  - current production mode: EN-only publishing (`--langs en`) for X/Threads
• weekly KPI retro generator: `scripts/growth/weekly_kpi_report.py` (`app.site_events` + activation proxy from `app.identities`/`bot.watchlist`)
• visual post templates in `assets/social/` (Top3, Breakout, Weekly recap)
• positioning message pack: `docs/positioning_messages_latest.md` (site/bot/social interception copy)
• C1 site implementation contract:
  - landing hero carries “action over dashboard” framing
  - landing FAQ includes explicit “Why Telegram-first?” answer
  - `/telegram-bot` SEO page copy is synchronized with the 3-message C1 frame

Operational deploy notes (2026-03-08):

• monorepo Railway deploy must use service path roots:
  - `site`: `railway up -s site --path-as-root api`
  - `bot`: `railway up -s bot --path-as-root bot`
• deploying from repo root without `--path-as-root` can fail Railpack autodetection and leave previous deployment active
